# JBomberman

JBomberman is a revamped and customized version of the classic game Bomberman. The project was developed as part of the Programming 2 course at "La Sapienza" University (Rome, Italy).

## Project Description

JBomberman is a game that combines strategy and action. The player controls Bomberman, a character who must place bombs in a maze, destroy enemies, collect power-ups, and reach the exit to complete levels.

## Key Features

- **MVC Architecture**: Implementation of the Model-View-Controller architecture to separate game logic, presentation, and interaction control.
- **Design Patterns**: Application of design patterns such as Observer-Observable, Singleton, and Factory to improve code structure and dependency management.
- **Level Management**: Configuration of levels through JSON files, allowing easy and flexible addition of new levels.
- **Collisions**: Implementation of collisions between characters, objects, and the map using "ghosting" and collision box intersection detection.
- **Stream Usage**: Utilization of Java streams for filtering, collecting, and entity control.
- **Player Database**: Implementation of a JSON database for local saving of players and their game records.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Compile and run the project using your preferred IDE.
3. Play through the levels, interact with enemies, collect power-ups, and enjoy the Bomberman challenge!

## Requirements

- Installed Java Development Kit (JDK).
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.) for compilation and execution.
